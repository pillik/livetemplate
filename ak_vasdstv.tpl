If you are a Property Developer, Body Corporate or DStv Subscriber - Read on!
</strong></p></center>


<center><img src="/images/dstv1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="dstv"/></center>
<br />


<p><strong>Welcome to an exciting innovation from DStv.</strong> - 

It's called the Communal Distribution Fibre System (CFDS) but we'll call it
	"communal distribution" here to make things simpler.</p>

<p>Communal distribution means an end to unsightly clusters of satellite
dishes and tangles of cables. It means a better viewing experience for DStv
subscribers and a better view of the outside of each property.</p>

<p>Using existing broadband fibre networks, communal distribution allows just
one satellite dish to provide full DStv service to up to 256 homes or units in
a single complex, estate or apartment block - thanks to sophisticated signal
conversion and splitting technology. DStv customers will experience reduced
signal degradation as the loss of signal in optical fibre is far less than in copper
wire.</p>

<p>Communal distribution over fibre has almost unlimited bandwidth, is suitable
for long cable runs and is fully approved by MultiChoice.</p>

<p>This page describes the advantages of communal distribution for property
developers, Body Corporates and DStv customers.</p>

<br />

<p>
<strong>Benefits for Property Developers</strong> - 
Incorporating DStv communal distribution into each new-build estate or
complex adds value while saving you time and money.</p>

<br />
<p><center><img src="/images/dstv2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="dstv"/></center></p>
<br />

<p><strong>It's cheaper and more convenient</strong> - 
MultiChoice will subsidise the once-off installation costs of communal
distribution infrastructure in new-build estates, complexes and apartment
blocks to let you offer an attractive, cost-effective value-add for future property
owners, that already have a fibre distribution system in place. Installing
communal distribution during the construction phase means no inconvenience
to home-owners after they move in, and allows for seamless integration with
	all other network infrastructure.</p>
	
<p>MultiChoice will recommend a local Accredited and Approved Systems
Integrator to monitor and maintain the communal distribution system.</p>

<p><strong>The properties you build will be even more attractive</strong> - 
The single communal distribution dish can be situated in the most discreet
location, and each finished property will be ready to receive DStv through
communal distribution over fibre.</p>

<p>Building more aesthetically pleasing homes, equipped with the latest digital
television technology, will boost property values and help attract young,
successful homebuyers.</p>

<br />

<p><strong>Benefits for Body Corporates</strong> - 
As a homeowners' association or body corporate, DStv communal
distribution brings you important benefits.</p>

<br />
<p><center><img src="/images/dstv3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="dstv"/></center></p>
<br />

<p><strong>You'll save money</strong> - 
MultiChoice has set aside budget to upgrade existing single cable systems to
a preferred DStv communal distribution system (over fibre), which means a
	major saving for each homeowner.</p>

<p><strong>There'll be fewer cables, and only one dish</strong> - 	
By piggy-backing on your estate or complex's existing broadband fibre
network, you'll have far fewer cables. Plus, the properties you manage will be
	much more aesthetically pleasing without individual satellite dishes.</p>
	
<p><strong>One point of call does it all</strong> - 
MultiChoice will recommend a single DStv Approved and Accredited Systems
Integrator to install and maintain the DStv communal distribution satellite dish
	and LNB. In the unlikely event of any network issues, one call will fix it all.</p>
	
<p>Having a single appointed Systems Integrator means you can avoid the 
security and quality issues that come with having multiple contractors wanting
to access your complex or estate.</p>
 
<p><strong>Maintenance made easy</strong> - 
DStv communal distribution uses a central server room, so control and
maintenance of the DStv service is easier than ever.</p>

<br />

<p><strong>Benefits for DStv Customers</strong> - 
If you're a DStv customer and you live in a complex, apartment block or estate
that has access to a broadband fibre internet network, then you can benefit
from being upgraded to a DStv communal distribution system.
This means that your estate or apartment block now only needs one
communal satellite dish and LNB, rather than a dish for every property. Your
DStv signal will travel at the speed of light through the fibre network, to a
dedicated point in your home.</p>

<p><strong>There are loads of advantages to communal distribution:</strong></p>  
<p>- No need for a satellite dish at each home.<br />
- There'll also be fewer cables, so your home will look better than ever.<br />
- Fibre-optic cables are around 30x thinner than coaxial cables, so they take
up less ducting space.<br />
- Communal distribution over fibre is compatible with all existing DStv
Explora and HD decoders.<br />
- You'll only need two additional small wall-mounted boxes in your home -
that's it.<br />
- Your decoder settings will be automatically updated.<br />
- It's the most reliable and efficient way to enjoy all your favourite content.<br />
- You'll have a single point of contact in the event of any problems.</p>


<p><strong>Plus, if you connect your DStv Explorer to the internet, you can take
	advantage of all the options that a Connected Explorer offers:</strong></p>

                <p>We'll spare you all the jargon, but basically communal distribution uses a single satellite dish with a special LNB to receive the DStv signal and convert it to an optical signal that can travel at lightning-fast speeds through fibre cables to your home, where it's converted back to an electrical or RF signal that your DStv Explora or HD decoder can read.

                <p>It's much more reliable and efficient. Fibre-optic cables are weather-proof and
won't get stolen. Compared to outdated copper or coaxial cables, fibre can carry a signal further and faster. Plus, think how much better your home will look without that dish stuck on the outside! </p>

You'll also be able to add XtraView and BoxOffice, just as you can now.
