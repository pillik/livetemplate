<p>This signed Authority and Mandate refers to our contract as dated as on signature hereof ("the
Agreement"). I / We hereby authorise you to issue and deliver payment instructions to the bank for
collection against my / our abovementioned account at my / our above mentioned bank (or any
other bank or branch to which I / We may transfer my / our account) on condition that the sum of
such payment instructions will never exceed my / our obligations as agreed to in the Agreement,
and commencing on the commencement date and continuing until this Authority and Mandate is
terminated by me / us by giving you notice in writing of no less than 20 ordinary working days, and
sent by prepaid registered post or delivered to your address indicated above.
The individual payment instructions so authorised to be issued must be issued and delivered as
	follows </p>
<p>On the 7th day ("payment day") of each and every month commencing on __________________. In the event that the payment day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or recognized South African public holiday,
the payment day will automatically be the very next ordinary business day. Further, if there are
insufficient funds in the nominated account to meet the obligation, you are entitled to track my
account and re-present the instruction for payment as soon as sufficient funds are available in my
account;</p>
<p>I / We understand that the withdrawals hereby authorised will be processed through a computerized
system provided by the South African Banks and I also understand that details of each withdrawal
will be printed on my bank statement. Each transaction will contain a number, which must be
included in the said payment instruction and if provided to you should enable you to identify the
Agreement. A payment reference is added to this form before the issuing of any payment
instruction. I / We shall not be entitled to any refund of amounts which you have withdrawn while
this authority was in force, if such amounts were legally owing to you.</p>                            
<p><strong>MANDATE</strong></p>
<p>I / We acknowledge that all payment instructions issued by you shall be treated by my/our above
mentioned bank as if the instructions had been issued by me/us personally.</p> 
<p><strong>CANCELLATION</strong></p>               
<p>I / We agree that although this Authority and Mandate may be cancelled by me / us, such
cancellation will not cancel the Agreement. I / We shall not be entitled to any refund of amounts
which you have withdrawn while this authority was in force, if such amounts were legally owing to
you.</p>                             
<p><strong>ASSIGNMENT</strong></p>                                           
<p>I / We acknowledge that this Authority may be ceded to or assigned to a third party if the agreement
is also ceded or assigned to that third party, but in the absence of such assignment of the
Agreement, this Authority and Mandate cannot be assigned to any third party.</p>

 <p><strong>Peace of mind clause:</strong><br />
We are aware that many clients are wary of signing debit orders, for this reason we have introduced
the "peace of mind clause". As stated in our terms and conditions we have no contracts, and
cancellations are immediate upon notification by e-mail to whmbilling@sadomain.co.za, this means
no future invoices. In the event of an invoice slipping through our systems and being debited we will
refund the monies immediately upon notification by e-mail. All debited amounts will match invoices
issued and invoices outstanding. Should there be a discrepancy please contact us telephonically on
021 â€“ 565 0018 and ask for the accounts department. Domains will also be renewed through the
debit order system once debit order is activated.</p>
